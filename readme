●	Then the server provides the following functions:
   ○	Display the current highest bid of stocks via a GUI : Once the ID is given, the client is expected to 
        provide the Symbol of the item he/she is willing to bid on. If the provided Symbol is found the server 
		should reply back with the current highest bid or -1 to indicate that the Symbol is invalid. 
		(Assume that no two people bid within an interval of 500ms.)
          ■	Query Format : [SYM]
            ● eg: AAPL
          ■	Output Format : (Bid) / -1
            ● eg: 10
   ○	Accept bids: The server must accept new bids if the bid is higher than the current bid of the item. 
        If the bid is successful, the new bid becomes the highest bid and the server must reply back with the new bid. 
		If the symbol is invalid the server replies  -1 and if the bid is lower than or equal to the current bid or  if the  
		bid time has expired, the server replies -2.
          ■	Query Format : [SYM] (Bid)
            ● eg: AAPL 15
          ■	Output Format : (Bid) / -1/-2
            ● eg: 15


***connect Publisher - Subscriber to port 2022
1.	Updating profit information : The publishers (companies) must be able to publish the monthly profits to inform all the stakeholders
    regarding the financial status of each item. The subscribers on the other hand must be able to subscribe and get immediate updates 
	on these financial information as soon as they’re published. The query formats for both the subscribers and the publishers are 
	given below.
        ○	Publish updated profits : The publisher must be able to publish monthly profits by providing a valid Symbol and Security
     		number. If the information is valid, the server must reply 0, and if invalid, the server will reply -1
          ■	Query Format : [SYM] [SEC] (Profit)
            ● eg: AAPL 12345 150
          ■	Output Format : 0/-1
		  
        ○	Subscribe to get updates on profits: The subscriber must be able to subscribe by providing the item symbols and then receive 
		    updates continuously. Subscription is done by providing valid space separated symbols. (SYM1, SYM2, SYM3 are the symbols of 
			different items.) If the subscription is successful, the user would get a space separated output of 0 if the symbol is valid
			or -1 otherwise for each symbol. Once subscribed, the subscriber gets the symbol and profit at each update.
          ■	Query Format : PRFT [SYM1] [SYM2] [SYM3]
            ● eg: PRFT AAPL AMZN
          ■	Output Format : 0/-1 0/-1 0/-1
            ● eg: 0 0
          ■	Subscriber output : [SYM] PRFT (Profit)
            ● eg: AAPL PRFT 150

2.	Updates on bids : Interested stakeholders can track bids of an item and get updates as the bid of the particular item increases. 
        ○	Subscribe to get updates on bid changes: The subscriber can subscribe to a particular item and once subscribed they must be
     		notified whenever the bid is updated. The query and the outputs are similar to the previous case.
          ■	Query Format : BID [SYM1] [SYM2] [SYM3]
            ● eg: BID AAPL AXXN
          ■	Output Format : 0/-1 0/-1 0/-1
            ● eg: 0 -1
          ■	Subscriber output : [SYM] BID (Bid)
            ● eg: AAPL BID 15
